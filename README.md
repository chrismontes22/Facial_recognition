This is a protype of a facial detection application that could be used to then reverse image search someone based off a picture. It uses Flask as the application framework. For the picture, it can either directly take a picture or accept an upload. If the model detects multiple faces in an image, it allows the user to click on the face they would like to search! After the face is chosen, the app crops the face and performs a reverse image search with Selenium. Unfortunately Google has significantly downgraded their reverse image search, so the concept has to end there.

There is another small script that shows how the app would have then returned text information using Selenium. The reverse image search ws supposed to find the correct person based off their linked in, but will mainly only find you if you are really famous or you have the exact picture of someone with a decent following (as in that exact picture would have had to been posted; not just any picture of the person).
